#### The story of Some Button

> dedicated to all, who ever created their own Button. or is going to :)

once upon a time a great idea came up to mind. What if i do some button web page? it will be very intersting and funny and many users will be happy:)

and the SomeButton page was created

users should open console, press button and see how data arrives back. Pretty awesome

however users met a bug, if they press button many times before first data ready, unexpectedly additional data requests dispatched

i fixed a bug and everyone became happy... 

however many users complained about they should open console to see the data. So the decision was made to implement new feature: render data to UI without console.

once iphone with AppStore was released, i decided that "page" is not good name, and the SomeButton page should grow, to be proudly named the "application" - abbreviated as SPA - SingleSomeButton Page Application. Also there was a plan to create new feature - "AwesomeButton" so i added some utils to help me create new features fast.

after i refactored SomeButton from page to application, a bright idea came up to mind (again):

What if i will help many other users to create their own PrettyButton and GreatButton applications?

to be honest, my SomeButtom app already lost popularity because of many third party applications like SearchButton, SocialButton, SoftButton etc were released. It is worth to mention that after SoftButton was bought by MicroButton, combined to one app - it became one of market most popular apps...

and i created a lib... hmmm.. stop - not a lib - the Framework! To be free available for everyone to create any Button they like.
