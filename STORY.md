#### The story of Some Button

> dedicated to all, who ever created their own Button. Or is going to :)

Once upon a time a great idea came up to my mind. What if i created some button web page? It seems to be very intersting and funny  - many users are to be entertained:)

And the SomeButton page appeared!

Users should open console, press button and see how data arrives back. Pretty awesome

However users met a bug: if they press button many times before first data ready, unexpectedly additional data requests dispatched

I fixed a bug and everyone became happy... 

However many users complained about they should open console to see the data. So the decision was made to implement new feature: render data to UI without console.

Once an iphone along with AppStore has released, i decided that the "page" is not a proper name - the SomeButton page should grow - to be proudly named the "application"! Abbreviated as SPA - the SingleSomeButton Page Application. Also the plan is to create a new feature - "AwesomeButton". So i implemented the "utils" to help me create new features fast.

After a refactoring of SomeButton from page to the application, a bright idea came up to my mind (again):

What if i could help many other users to create their own PrettyButton and GreatButton applications?

To be honest, the SomeButtom app already lost popularity because of many third party applications like SearchButton, SocialButton, SoftButton etc were released. It is worth mentioning that after SoftButton had been bought by MicroButton, combined to one app - it became one of market most popular apps...

And i created a lib... hmmm.. actually - not a lib - the Framework! To be free available for everyone to create any Button they like.
